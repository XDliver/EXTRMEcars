# EXTRMEcars
This game is made with unity engine. this project is also made with other open source add-ons and stuff from the unity assest store.

The road, road signs and, the rails are made with a project on github called RoadArchitect: https://github.com/MicroGSD/RoadArchitect. This game's source code along with the game will be relesed. As of right now, the relese is only compiled for mac. I will later on compile for windows and linux. Once this as become public, please be creative and do modificaations and be sure to send it to me or the orthers who have developed this game. 

There should be three releases. The first one(EXTRMEcars_) is the main one. For this version, there will be crazy roads and huge ramps for the first car not any other cars. I have done everything I could to try so that the brirdge does not affect the road underneath. For the second version, it features an older map(which I was lazy to update) which does not include the crazy bridges. It does have trees which the newer maps don't have.
